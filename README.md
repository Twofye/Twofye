- 👋 Hi, I’m @Twofye
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring my creative side through app development along with coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding through xcode and SwiftUI.  I would consider this a hobby I recently took on, so I am teaching myself as I go.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with likeminded individuals who are looking to just enjoy the process and have fun along the way.
- 📫 If you are interested in joining me in having fun as we create you can reach here if its possible.  I can also be reach via email @George.olriedge25@gmail.com
